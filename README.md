# Basic NFT MarketPlace where one can mint their own NFTs.

This project is created to run on Ethereum. The project has been build using Hardhat framework. We have used Replit to create a basic front-end for the users to interact with the contract using their metamask wallet.
Link to Front end: https://nft-starter-project.jkitis.repl.co/

```shell

npx hardhat clean
